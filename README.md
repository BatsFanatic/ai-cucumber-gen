This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This app has been setup using Next.js mostly with default settings and but agian it depends on your app. This app has been developed in javaScript and you can use typeScript too.

When the setup has been completed, the page (where api routing) can be found in src/app. For this particular project, I created pages for api (for backend) and index (for frontend ui). if you followed the same as me, then delete the page from src/app as when you are using Next.js, you can have only one page for API instructions.

## ✅ Recommended Setup: OpenRouter + Mistral / Mixtral / Claude via OpenAI-compatible API
## 🔧 Why this works:
✅ Simple, OpenAI-compatible

✅ Supports Mistral, Claude, LLaMA 3, Command R+, and more

✅ Free tier with no credit card required

✅ Works exactly like OpenAI’s chat/completions API

## 🔐 Step 1: Create OpenRouter API Key
Go to: https://openrouter.ai/

Log in with GitHub or Google

Copy your API key from: https://openrouter.ai/account/keys

## 🛠 Step 2: Add to ```.env```
```OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here```

## 🛠 Step 3:
```npm install```

## Run the app
```npm run dev```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/api/generate-feature.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
